The major distinction revolves around whether you want to investigate an (experimental) factor that varies or is manipulated within subjects or that varies across subjects (i.e. individual differences or experimental between-subject designs). \n",

Essentially, you just subtract each column's mean from each value in the column and then divide each value in the column by the standard deviation in the column;<br><br>\n",

This method should first load in the mask (using nibabel), then make a boolean array of the mask (array with True for voxels above the threshold, False for those below) and ravel (flatten) the result in a 1D vector, and finally use this boolean mask-array to index and update the columns of the `X` attribute such that afterwards it only contains voxels specified in the thresholded mask. <br><br>\n",
