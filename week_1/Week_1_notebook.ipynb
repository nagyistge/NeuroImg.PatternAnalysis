    "## 1. Designs for pattern analyses\n",
    "There are many ways in which you can categorize different types of pattern analyses (a topic which you'll work on in Thursdays's seminar), but one of the most basic categorizations is in terms of whether analyses are **within-subject** or **between-subject**. The major distinction revolves around whether you want to investigate an (experimental) factor that varies or is manipulated within subjects or that varies across subjects (i.e. individual differences or experimental between-subject designs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, both types of analyses differ in what is regarded as an *instance of a pattern*:\n",
    "- in within-subject analyses, *each instance of your feature-of-interest represents one pattern*;\n",
    "- in between-subject analyses, *each subject represents one pattern*.\n",

    "3. extract patterns of $\\beta$-estimates by fitting a HRF per trial using the GLM you're familiar with; \n",

The second method, named `demean_data()`, should subtract the temporal mean from each voxel in the `data` attribute and store the result in the `data` attribute again (effectively \"updating\" it). A third method, named `plot_histogram_of_values()`. This method should take the `data` attribute and make a histogram of all its **non-zero** values using matplotlib (google how to do this if you forgot!). The method should take one parameter, `bins`, that is used in the matplotlib histogram function to control the number of bins. Hint: set the default range in the histogram to (-500, 500).\n",
