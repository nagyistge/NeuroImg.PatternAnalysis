    "# Week 2: decoding analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "This week's tutorial is about how to implement decoding analyses in Python. We'll be looking at the implementation of concepts like K-fold cross-validation, feature-selection/extraction, model fitting/prediction, permutation testing, and feature visualization. To do so, we'll use the [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org) machine learning package in Python (the de-facto and most-used ML package in Python). In this tutorial, we'll use the PIOP-dataset (**P**opulation **I**maging **O**f **P**sychology), a large-scale (>240 subjects) multimodal MRI-dataset, including structural (gray-matter [VBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel-based_morphometry) and white-matter [TBSS](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/TBSS)), resting-state (incl. [dual regression](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/DualRegression) data), and task-based functional data. Along with this set of MRI-scans, the PIOP-study also acquired a set of behavioral (psychometric) variables from various questionnaires and behavioral task (outside the scanner) of the same participants who were scanned. As such, this makes it an excellent data-set for decoding analyses in which you can use neural patterns (from any MRI modality; `X`) to predict a behavioral variable (`y`). This is, by the way, also one of the data-sets that you can use for your final project (more info on Blackboard/week_4).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll focus on a specific decoding analysis in which *we try to predict intelligence (y) from brain patterns (X) associated with working memory processing* (based on the same data as you practiced with in the tutorial of week 1). Throughout the tutorial, we'll discuss all the steps necessary to answer this research question. (Mini-ToThink: is this a within- or between-subject analysis?)\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of skills, after this tutorial you are be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load and appropriately transform dependent variables (`y`) corresponding to your patterns (`X`);\n",
    "* Apply basic [preprocessing](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html) to your patterns;\n",
    "* Implement [feature-selection](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#feature-selection) and extraction processes;\n",
    "* Build fully cross-validated [pipelines](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html#sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline) using scikit-learn;\n",
    "* Run appropriate statistics (including permutation tests) on your model performance scores;\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, we do *not* cover feature visualization because it is quite complicated to implement, especially in combination with feature-selection. Also, \"mapping\" should not be your goal in decoding studies, anyway. \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, in combination with the knowledge/skills you acquired from last week's tutorial, you'll be able to implement a complete decoding pipeline yourself at the end of this tutorial!"

    "### A note about standardization\n",
    "We briefly touched upon the issue of \"standardization\" last week, but the process of standardization is especially important in decoding analyses, so it warrants some extra explanation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As explained before, standardization refers to the process of converting numbers in a vector to the (signed) number of standard deviations it deviates from the mean of the vector. Formally, for a vector `x` with mean $\\bar{x}$ and standard deviation $s_{x}$ and length `N`, the standardized value of element $x_{i}$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "x_{i} = \\frac{x_{i} - \\bar{x}}{s_{x}}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, standardization in machine learning is applied to each column (i.e. feature), ensuring that each feature (in decoding: voxel) is on the same scale. In other words, standardization ensures that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"But *why* do you have to standardize your features?\", you might reasonably ask. Well, that has to do with the way many ML models calculate their parameters (i.e. $\\beta$; this process is called 'gradient descent'). For most models, this process may fail to converge and thus is unable to calculate the model's parameters is not all features are on the same scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, just remember that *before you do any model fitting* your features should be standardized\\*. Fortunately, you already implemented this yourself last week as a method in your mvp-class: the `standardize()` method! So, before we go on, let's just standardize our features:\n",

    "In some scenario's you might want to recode your continuous dependent variable (y) into a categorical one. One reason is simply because fMRI patterns are incredibly noisy, and classification analyses are more robust than regression analyses. Note, though, that if you recode your continuous DV into a categorical one, your conclusions about your model also become weaker: regression models allow you to explain/model variance across a larger interval than classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, would you be more impressed if told you I could model predict your IQ with an error of +/- 2 points (a continuous DV) or if I told you I could only predict whether your IQ is higher or lower than 100 (a categorical DV)? Given that your dependent variable is truly continuous, it's better to subject it to a regression analysis in terms of strength of your conclusion, but given the very noisy nature of fMRI data it may be advantageous to trade in some of this inferential strength for some extra SNR by recoding your DV into a categorical variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is probably also the reason that *classification* analyses are way more popular in the fMRI community than *regression* analyses. That's why we'll recode the Raven score into a categorical variable and continue with that for the rest of the tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "But how should we recode our DV? There are various ways to do this, but we'll use the median-split: any values above the median of `y` will be coded as 1 and any values below the median of `y` will be coded 0. Thus, our updated decoding goal is to predict whether someone has a high intelligence (`y = 1`) or low intelligence (`y = 0`).  \n",

    "## 4. Feature selection/extraction\n",
    "As discussed before, a small sample/feature-ratio often results in overfitting (optimistic performance estimates on train-set). It follows then that reducing the amount of features often has a beneficial effect on cross-validated performance estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature reduction can be achieved in two principled ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* feature extraction: transform your features into a set of lower-dimensional components;\n",
    "* feature selection: select a subset of features\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of feature extraction are PCA (i.e. transform voxels to orthogonal components) and averaging features within brain regions from an atlas. Because feature extraction often does not use any information from the labels (`y`), this step does not need to be cross-validated (but you *can* cross-validate, e.g., PCA by estimating the components on the train-set only). \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of feature selection are ROI-analysis (i.e. restricting your patterns to a specific ROI in the brain) and \"univariate feature selection\" (UFS). This latter method is an often-used data-driven method to select features based upon their univariate difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, scikit-learn has a bunch of feature selection/extraction objects for us to use. These objects (\"transformers\" in scikit-learn lingo) work similarly to estimators: they also have a `fit(X, y)` method, in which for example the univariate differences (in UFS) or PCA-components (in PCA-driven feature extraction) are computed. Then, instead of having a `predict(X)` method, transformers have a `tranform(X)` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at how UFS can be implemented using scikit-learn. Basically, it follows the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "`transformer = Selector(score_func=ufs_function, other_args)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `score_func` parameter takes a function that implements a univariate statistical test (like an [f-test](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif.html#sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif) or a [chi-square test](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif.html#sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif)). The `Selector` class determines how to select the subset of features based on the result of the `score_func`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the [SelectKBest](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest.html#sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest) selector selects the best `K` features based on their scores from the statistical test.

    "While group-level statistics in within-subject decoding analyses are easily implemented (usually with a t-test of subject-wise accuracy scores against chance level), between-subject decoding analyses are trickier. That is because the data-points in between-subject analyses - usually the accuracy scores associated with different folds in K-fold CV - are *not independent* - which is an important assumption of all parametric statistics (such as t-tests). \n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the lecture, dependence between data-points is created because the same samples may be included in different folds. This may not immediately make sense, but imagine the following: suppose we have 100 samples. For some reason, there is one sample that is *suuuuper* noisy. In fact, everytime it is included in the train-set (90%, so 90 trials), it messes up the fit of the model so badly, that it always leads to chance-level predictions on the test-set (on average only 5 samples in the test set are predicted correctly). When this noisy sample is included in the test-set, however, it doesn't mess up the model fit, and on average the test-set is predicted correctly with 80% accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, this super noisy sample actually creates dependence between the accuracies associated with the folds in which it has been part of the train-set: these accuracies are *all* relatively lower than the folds in which this sample was part of the test-set. \n",

    "### 5.1. Getting your *observed* performance score\n",
    "Before you start with anything related to permutation testing, you first need to get your performance score that you would like to get a p-values for. In between-subject decoding analyses, this is usually the average accuracy (or whatever other metric) across folds. So, when you would implement a 10-fold cross-validation scheme, your observed performance score would be the average of the accuracy-estimates across those 10 folds. You know what? Let's implement exactly that.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, however, we won't do any data-drive feature selection, but we'll implement a ROI-based decoding analysis in which we only use the patterns in the left amygdala. This choice for the left amygdala is not theoretically motivated (the amygdala is unlikely to contain any information during a working memory task that is predictive for intelligence ... but you never know...), but is rather a practical concern: permutation testing takes a loooooot of time, and by limiting ourselves to a small subset of features (i.e. voxels in the left amygdala), we substantially speed up the (permutation) analysis.\n",

    "### 5.2. Getting your *permuted* performance distribution\n",
    "The goal of permutation tests are to create a null-distribution of your observed measure, in this case: (average) classification accuracy. The null-distribution refers to the distribution of classification accuracies that would arise if you would repeat an experiment with noisy data in which there is no effect (i.e. the null-hypothesis is true). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we need to somehow repeat the above \"experiment\" (i.e. the analysis which yielded the observed performance of 52.9%) yet while the null-hypothesis is true (i.e. there is no effect, only noise). Well, as the term \"permutation\" suggest, we can simply randomly shuffly the train-labels (`y_train`) to generate random labels. Now, if we would fit the classifier on {`X_train`, and `y_train`}, then practically it would fit on noise. In fact, by random shuffling of the train-labels, we simulated the scenario in which (on average) the null-hypothesis would be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what we need to do in order to create a null-distribution of classification-accuracies is to run our original analysis (in the code cell above) many times (i.e. \"repeat the experiment\"), yet with random labeling of our train-samples. We expect that the mean of these null-accuracies would center around .5 (assumed chance level), but simply due to random noise, our simulated null-distribution will contain values (sometimes substantially) above and below chance level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, look at the code-cell below. It contains exactly the same analysis as in the above code-block, yet now it is looped 1000 times, and just before fitting (within every fold separately) we shuffle the train-labels to generate a random mapping between `X_train` and `y_train`. After every \"experiment\" (or simply \"permutation\") we average the permuted accuracy scores across folds and store them (in the variable `permuted_accuracies`). Now, let's run the code cell below (may take minute):"
