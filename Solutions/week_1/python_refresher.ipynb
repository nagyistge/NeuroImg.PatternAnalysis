    "Basically, you are using the web-browser as a kind of editor from which you can run python code, similar to the MATLAB interactive editor or RStudio. The cool thing about these notebooks is that they allow you to mix code \"cells\" (see below) and text \"cells\" (such as this one). The (printed) output from code blocks are displayed right below the code blocks themselves. \n",

Most importantly, in command mode, the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts that let you perform notebook and cell actions efficiently (some shortcuts in command mode will be discussed later!). Enter command mode by pressing Esc or using the mouse to click outside a cell’s editor area; <br><br>\n",
    "- Edit mode is indicated by a green cell border and a prompt showing in the editor area: When a cell is in edit mode, you can type into the cell, like a normal text editor. Enter edit mode by pressing Enter or using the mouse to double-click on a cell’s editor area.\n",

While R is mostly used for statistics, and php is used for web programming only, Python is a general language, specified by the packages you add on to it (using import statements). So, \"pure\" Python provides some basic functionality, but Python's versatility comes from specialized packages for almost any purpose. \n",

    "* the [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) package provides functionality for scientific computing (e.g. statistics, signal processing);\n",

    "* the [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) package provides plotting functions;\n",
    "* and various specialied neuroimaging packages provide functionality to work and analyze (f)MRI (e.g. [nibabel](http://nipy.org/nibabel/) and [nipype](http://nipy.org/nipype)) and MEG/EEG (e.g. [MNE](http://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html)).\n",

    "### Numpy: methods vs. functions\n",
    "In the previous section (Basic Python), you've learned that, in addition to functions, 'methods' exist that are like functions of an object. In other words, methods are functions that are applied to the object itself. You've seen examples of list methods, e.g. `my_list.append(1)`, and string methods, e.g. `my_string.count('b')`. Like lists and strings, numpy arrays have a lot of convenient methods that you can call. Again, this is just like a function, but then applied to itself. Often, numpy provides both a function and method for simple operations. Let's look at an example: "

    "Usually, statistic files are plotted on top of an background image that shows the outlines of the brain so that you can see where the significant activity is located. Here, we'll use the functional file (`func_data`) averaged across the time-dimension as a background image. Then, we'll plot the statistics file (`stat_slice`) on top of the background file and color-code the values (more yellow = higher values) to see which voxels are (the most) active for negative compared to neutral images. Also, we have to define a threshold for which z-values (and thus corresponding voxels) are significant or not. Usually, a threshold of 2.3 for z-values is a sensible default (because it corresponds to a p-value of 0.01)."
