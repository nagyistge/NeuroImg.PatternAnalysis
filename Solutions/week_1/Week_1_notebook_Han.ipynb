    "# Week 1: design and data representation\n",
    "This week's tutorial/assignment will be about the basics of pattern analysis. It's very important that you understand the discussed concepts, as they form the basis of the rest of the course's tutorials/assignments. Additionally, we'll discuss some new programming concepts (mostly object-oriented programming), as this will become more and more important as you're going to learn how to program everything yourself in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, at the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the major differences between within- and between-subject first-level designs for pattern estimation;\n",
    "* Understand the concept of object-oriented programming and know how to construct classes for neuroimaging-purposes;\n",
    "* Implement functionality to load, organize, and efficiently represent voxel pattern for pattern analyses;\n",

    "## 1. Designs for pattern analyses\n",
    "There are many ways in which you can categorize different types of pattern analyses (a topic which you'll work on in Thursdays's seminar), but one of the most basic categorizations is in terms of whether analyses are **within-subject** or **between-subject**. The major distinction revolves around whether you want to investigate an (experimental) factor that varies or is manipulated within subjects or that varies across subjects (i.e. individual differences or experimental between-subject designs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, both types of analyses differ in what is regarded as an *instance of a pattern*:\n",
    "- in within-subject analyses, *each instance of your feature-of-interest represents one pattern*;\n",
    "- in between-subject analyses, *each subject represents one pattern*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 3 of this tutorial (Data representation), we'll discuss how these patterns in within- and between-subject analyses are typically represented. This part (Designs for pattern analyses) will focus on how to extract patterns from fMRI data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the lecture, there are three ways to extract patterns from fMRI data: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. extract activity at a certain timepoint (e.g. 3 TRs after stimulus presentation);\n",
    "2. extract the *average* activity within a time-range (e.g. 2-4 TRs after stimulus presentation);\n",
    "3. extract patterns of $\\beta$-estimates by fitting a HRF per trial using the GLM you're familiar with; \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this tutorial, we'll focus on method 3 (as this has been shown to yield the most stable pattern estimates). We will show you how the design matrices for the GLM in method 3 look like for both (single-trial) within-subject analyses and between-subject analyses. "

    "Often, \"trials\" (i.e. instances of your feature-of-interest) in within-subject designs are modelled as separate regressors in a first-level analysis. In other words, you model each trial as a separate (*single!*) HRF-response.

After you run a first-level analysis using this design, you'll have whole-brain maps containing statistics values (beta-values, t-values, or z-values) for each trial that represent the trial's estimated (whole-brain) pattern. Usually, t- or z-values are used instead of betas.  \n",

Then, write three methods: the first one - `load_data()` should read in the Nifti-file (using nibabel) and create a new attribute: `data` (which should be the loaded data as a 3D numpy array). The second method, named `demean_data()`, should subtract the temporal mean from each voxel in the `data` attribute and store the result in the `data` attribute again (effectively \"updating\" it). A third method, named `plot_histogram_of_values()`. This method should take the `data` attribute and make a histogram of all its **non-zero** values using matplotlib (google how to do this if you forgot!). The method should take one parameter, `bins`, that is used in the matplotlib histogram function to control the number of bins. Hint: set the default range in the histogram to (-500, 500).\n",

    "As you can see, the originally 3D voxel patterns (e.g. whole-brain patterns of t-values) are flattened (also called \"vectorized\" or \"raveled\") such that we can stack all patterns vertically into a 2D matrix. There are two reasons why pattern analyses need this 2D format and thus discard spatial information about the voxel patterns:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. There are very few analyses that take spatial information into account in the first place (so by flattening we get rid of the spatial information); \n",
    "2. Most algorithms used \"under the hood\" by pattern analyses rely heavily on matrix algebra (which operate on 2D matrices by definition).\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, let's look at an example. We're going to work with the working-memory data (as outline in the beginning of the notebook). Suppose we want to investigate whether we can predict whether a trial is passive or active (factor: working memory load) from (whole-brain) voxel patterns. Consequently, this is a **within-subject design**. As such, we model each trial separately by fitting a single-trial design matrix to obtain patterns of t-values per trial (similar to the plot just before section **1.3**). The results are in the directory: `WITHIN/sub-0037_workingmemory_WITHIN.feat`. Check out the directory (again) and especially the stats-folder. You should see a bunch of nifti-files which contain 3D voxel patterns with either \"pe\" (parameter estimates, FSLs way of referring to $\\beta$s), \"cope\", \"varcope\", \"zstat\", or \"tstat\" values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, we're going to use patterns of t-stats (as is generally recommended over $\\beta$s).<br>\n",
    "As you can see, there are 40 nifti-files with t-stats; these refer to the 40 trials in the experiment (32 active trials, 8 passive trials)! Given that we need to adhere to the data representation as outlined above, we are in the following situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we have**: 40 (3D) nifti-files<br>\n",
    "**What we need**: one 2D numpy array of shape 40 x {whatever amount of voxels there are in those niftis}\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, time to learn some Python gems that help us load in and transform those patterns into a usable 2D numpy matrix."

    "If you managed to do the two ToDos (wow, that's a horrible sentence), then you've managed to do one of the most important things in pattern analyses: getting the data (patterns) in the right format: a 2D matrix of samples-by-(brain-)features. As you've seen, \"samples\" refer to \"trials\" (i.e. any instance of your feature-of-interest) in within-subject analyses while samples refer subjects in between-subject analyses. The (brain-)features represent single-trial contrasts against baseline in within-subject analyses and a 'condition-average' contrast against baseline (e.g. active > baseline) or against another condition (e.g. active > passive) in between-subject analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here onwards, we will learn how to apply pattern analyses to data in this format, which is (in a way) *much* easier because we will use mostly existing packages (like [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) for decoding analyses). When you use the right tools, you can literally implement a pattern analysis is 30 lines of code. But that's for the next two weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final assignment of this week, you are going to create a custom class `Mvp` (which stands for **M**ulti**v**oxel **p**attern) that sort of \"organizes\" the loading process, data representation, and contains some methods that act upon (e.g. preprocess) the 2D samples-by-feature matrix. In the next weeks, you'll extend this Mvp-class with more functionality as you'll learn new things (e.g we'll add some decoding-related methods in week 2 and some RSA-related methods in week 3). "

    "**Assignment 2** (7 points). Create a new class, `Mvp`, that takes as input a list of paths to nifti-files that represent the samples in a given pattern analysis. This class should contain three methods:<br><br>\n",
    "1. a method `load()` that loads the nifti-files (which are by now an attribute) using a loop similar to the last ToDo; the resulting samples-by-features matrix should be bound to self as a new attribute \"`X`\";<br><br>\n",
    "2. another method, `standardize()`, that standardizes each feature (voxel) in the 2D `data` attribute. Standardization is a common \"preprocessing step\" in pattern analyses that ensures that feature (columns in the 2D matrix) has mean 0 and standard deviation 1 (more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling#Standardization)). Essentially, you just subtract each column's mean from each value in the column and then divide each value in the column by the standard deviation in the column;<br><br>\n",
    "3. a method `apply_mask()`, that takes two parameters, `path_to_mask`, which should be a nifti-file containing a mask (e.g. a mask of the amygdala), and `threshold`, a number that should indicate the minimum value that a voxel in the mask should take to be included in the mask. This method should first load in the mask (using nibabel), then make a boolean array of the mask (array with True for voxels above the threshold, False for those below) and ravel (flatten) the result in a 1D vector, and finally use this boolean mask-array to index and update the columns of the `X` attribute such that afterwards it only contains voxels specified in the thresholded mask. <br><br>\n",

    "1. Test your code! You can use the tstat_paths we \"globbed\" earlier from the `sub-0037_WITHIN.feat` directory; <br><br>\n",
    "2. The methods do not need to return anything: everything is applied to the internal attributes (mostly the `X` attribute); <br><br>\n",
    "3. We supplied a probabilistic amygdala mask for you (`sub-0037_workingmemory_WITHIN.feat/Left_Amygdala_mask_epi.nii.gz`) to test your `apply_mask()` method with. If your method works correctly, your `X` attribute should be of shape [40, 280] after applying the mask *with a threshold of 0* to it.<br><br>\n",
