Hidde/Jolien:

- Assignment 1: perfect
- Assigment 2: aaaaalmost perfect (6.5/7)

Feedback: first of all, very smart to first load in just one file to check out the voxel-dims (instead of hard-coding it)! The rest of your code was also perfectly fine, except for that you made one tinyyy mistake: you accidentally tried to threshold the loaded_mask variable - which is a Nifti1Image object (not an array! which is only created after calling the method get_data()) - instead of the "mask" variable. So, you did: "booled = loaded_mask > threshold", but you should have done: "booled = mask > threshold". Apart from that, well done.

Scarlett/Jurriaan:

- Assignment 1: perfect
- Assignment 2: a little inefficient (no need for for-loops! You can use broadcasting, like the temporal demeaning procedure you implemented earlier), but nonetheless correct!
- Feedback: well done!
- Grade: 10/10

Susanne/Jessica:

- Assignment 2: perfect
- Feedback: clear and efficient code and good implementations!
- Grade 10/10

Timo:

- Assignment 1: almost perfect. The range refers to the argument of the plt.hist() function, not the limit of the figure itself!
- Assignment 2: perfect.
